Python challenge homework

For Pypol:

I tried to order the unique_candidates list by appending to a list (add if not already in list) but for some reason I couldn't get the syntax right so I haven't managed to order it as yet. 

I also thought there might be a better way to create the list of unique candidates and list of votes so that I didn't need to know the number of candidates beforehand, but I haven't managed to do it.
